License: CC0
 Statement of Purpose
 .
 The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically
 confer exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the
 creator and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an
 original work of authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").
 .
 Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work
 for the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and
 scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without
 fear of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate
 in other works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any
 form whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation
 commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to the Commons to
 promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of
 creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or
 greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts
 of others.
 .
 For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any
 expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person
 associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or
 she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work,
 voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute
 the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and
 Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect
 of CC0 on those rights.
 .
 1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may
 be protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright
 and Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not
 limited to, the following:
 .
 - the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,
   communicate, and translate a Work;
 .
 - moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
 .
 - publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or
   likeness depicted in a Work;
 .
 - rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
   subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
 .
 - rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of
   data in a Work;
 .
 - database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of
   the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the
   legal protection of databases, and under any national implementation
   thereof, including any amended or successor version of such
   directive); and
 .
 - other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the
   world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national
   implementations thereof.
 .
 2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in
 contravention of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully,
 permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and
 surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and
 associated claims and causes of action, whether now known or unknown
 (including existing as well as future claims and causes of action), in
 the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum
 duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
 extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number
 of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without
 limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the
 "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of
 the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and
 successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to
 revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal
 or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the
 public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
 .
 3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any
 reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law,
 then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted
 taking into account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In
 addition, to the extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants
 to each affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non
 sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to
 exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in
 all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by
 applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii)
 in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and
 (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
 commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "License"). The
 License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by
 Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any reason
 be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such
 partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the
 remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms
 that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining
 Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any
 associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work, in
 either case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
 .
 4. Limitations and Disclaimers.
 .
 - No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived,
   abandoned, surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this
   document.
 .
 - Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or
   warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied,
   statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of
   title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non
   infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy,
   or the present or absence of errors, whether ornot discoverable, all
   to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
 .
 - Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other
   persons that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including
   without limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the
   Work. Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any
   necessary consents, permissions or other rights required for any
   use of the Work.
 .
 - Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not
   a party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect
   to this CC0 or use of the Work.
